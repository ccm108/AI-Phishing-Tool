# AI Phishing Detector 🛡️🤖
An AI-powered web app that analyzes emails and detects phishing attempts. Paste an email into the chat interface, and the AI provides a **risk score**, **classification**, and **findings**.

## How It's Made 🛠️

**Tech used:** Python 🐍, React ⚛️ (TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS), Machine Learning 🧠

This project has a **React frontend** where users paste emails into a chatbot interface. The frontend sends the email to a **Python backend** running a machine learning model (`trained_model.py`) that analyzes the text. `main.py` handles requests, processes the email, and returns:  
- A phishing **risk score** 📊  
- **Classification** (phishing or legitimate) ✅❌  
- Key findings highlighting suspicious patterns 🔍

The backend and frontend are fully integrated, providing **real-time results** in a clean, easy-to-read UI ⚡

## Optimizations ⚡

- Backend model is pre-loaded to reduce response time ⏱️  
- Frontend updates asynchronously without page reloads 🔄  
- Clean component structure in React for maintainability 🧩  
- Transparent icons and responsive design for all screen sizes 📱💻

## Lessons Learned 📚

- Learned how to integrate a machine learning model with a full-stack web app 🧠💻  
- Gained experience handling real-time data between frontend and backend 🔗  
- Improved skills in Python API design and React UI development 🐍⚛️  
- Learned the importance of clean documentation and user-friendly design ✍️🖥️
